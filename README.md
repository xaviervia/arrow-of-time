# Arrow of time

Experiment with minimum possible composable implementation of a history (such as a Redux store, Act history, etc).

To try it out, clone the repo and `npm install`. Then `npm start` and head to `http://localhost:3000/demo/timeline.html` and `http://localhost:3000/demo/snapshot.html`.
